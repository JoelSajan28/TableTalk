# TableTalk â€” Conversational Analytics for Your Excel Data

**TabulaRAG** is a web application that transforms your Excel files into an intelligent, query-ready database.  
Each worksheet becomes its own MongoDB collection, pivot tables are generated automatically, and relations between tables are detected.  
A built-in LLM-powered chatbot lets you ask natural language questions â€” even across multiple sheets â€” and provides answers backed by your original documents.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Excel to Database** â€” Each worksheet is ingested into MongoDB as a separate collection.
- **Auto Pivot Tables** â€” Automatically create useful pivot views for quick insights.
- **Relation Discovery** â€” Detect and store relationships between tables for joins.
- **Conversational Queries** â€” Use natural language to query your data via an LLM + RAG pipeline.
- **Multi-Table Reasoning** â€” Ask questions that require connecting data across collections.
- **Source Doclinks** â€” Trace answers back to the exact sheet, row, and cell in your original file.
